Read Me Generator

This application allows the user to create a readme file with ease. 

The user must input "node index.js" in the terminal to start the application. 

A series of prompts will display for the user: 

          "What is the title?
          "Please enter the description" 
          "Please enter the installation instructions"
          "Please enter Usage Information"
          "What are the contribution guidelines?"
          "Please enter test instructions" 
          "What type of license does your project have?"
          
After the user responds to each of these prompts, a read me file will be generated in the sample.md file. 

Enjoy!
